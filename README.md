Here is where my noodle code is stored so I can work on them later on.

*Most* of it is unfinished and has old code and packages so if it doesn't work its not my fault (And yes I won't update none of them except like ones thatt im working  on).


### How to download my (very long boring steps) project.
To downlaod my React and React native projects (depending on what it is) is to download them (search how you download them by yourself for react native make sure its Expo). And do `npm install` then `npm start`, (make sure you also downloaded npm and put this command in the terminal.) this mostly works on every project execpt non-managed, "basic" commands.
